# SipView: The AI-Powered Sui Improvement Proposal Tracker

SipView is a modern, open-source web application designed to help users browse, search, and understand Sui Improvement Proposals (SIPs). It leverages Generative AI to make complex blockchain governance proposals accessible to everyone, from core developers to curious community members.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run SipView locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm, pnpm, or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sip-view-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

This project requires a Google AI API key for its generative features and recommends a GitHub token for a higher API rate limit.

1.  Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

    -   **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** (Optional): Generate a personal access token from your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to avoid rate-limiting issues when fetching data.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

You need to run two processes in parallel in separate terminal windows:

-   **Terminal 1: Run the Next.js Frontend**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the web application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

-   **Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI Flows**

    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, which handles all the AI-powered summarization and explanation tasks.

Once both servers are running, you can open your browser to view the app.
